# Telegram Owner-Reply Bot (JavaScript) lets goo

Telegram bot that:
- responds in groups when `@OWNER_USERNAME` is tagged or users reply to bot messages
- responds only inside authorized groups from `AUTH_GROUP_IDS`
- replies as if it is the owner (via Groq)
- stores meaningful per-user memory in MongoDB
- keeps a fast in-memory index for frequent user memory reads
- notifies the owner privately when users ask to be contacted
- supports owner-only private commands

## Stack
- JavaScript (Node.js, ESM)
- Telegram: `node-telegram-bot-api`
- AI: Groq (`groq-sdk`)
- Database: MongoDB (`mongoose`)
- In-memory index: LRU-like `Map` cache

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
2. Copy env file and fill values:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
3. Run:
```bash
npm start
```

## Environment Variables
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Bot token from BotFather
- `OWNER_NAME`: Display name of the owner whose voice the bot uses
- `ASSISTANT_NAME`: Assistant identity (default: `Makima`)
- `OWNER_USERNAME`: Owner username without `@` (example: `username`)
- `OWNER_USER_ID`: Telegram numeric user id of owner
- `OWNER_CHAT_ID`: Optional; where owner notifications are sent (defaults to `OWNER_USER_ID`)
- `AUTH_GROUP_IDS`: Comma-separated allowed group IDs (example: `-1002231076068,-4999803462`)
- `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection string
- `GROQ_API_KEY`: Groq API key
- `GROQ_MODEL`: Groq model name (default: `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`)
- `CACHE_MAX_USERS`: Max user memories kept in in-memory index

## Behavior
- Group messages:
  - bot ignores all groups not in `AUTH_GROUP_IDS`
  - bot responds only when:
    - `@OWNER_USERNAME` is tagged, or
    - user replies to a previous bot message
  - if triggered:
    - checks if user requested owner contact (e.g. "tell your boss to message me")
    - if contact request:
      - replies in group: `Your message has been forwarded.`
      - sends owner notification in DM with user/group/message details
    - else:
      - generates owner-style reply with Groq
      - stores only meaningful memory signals (name, facts, summaries, past questions)

- Private chat:
  - owner can use commands
  - non-owner gets:
    - welcome note
    - "group-only" + "private chat not supported" guidance

## Owner Commands (DM only)
- `/stats`
- `/memory`
- `/memory <user_id>`
- `/feed <text>` (add owner context/instructions used in future replies)
- `/feed` (view latest stored owner feed memory)
- `/clear_user <user_id>`
- `/reply <user_id> <message>`

## Notes
- For `/reply <user_id> ...`, the recipient must have already started the bot in DM.
- Make sure the bot is added to groups and allowed to read group messages.
- Example feed:
  - `/feed - Hello Makima, I am XYZ, I am interested in DevOps, I am busy tonight; if someone asks, say boss is busy and will message later.`

## CI/CD (Docker + VPS)
- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Deployment is Docker-based (`Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.prod.yml`)
- VPS user is hardcoded as `root` in workflow
- VPS host is set in workflow env:
  - `VPS_HOST: "YOUR_VPS_HOST"` (replace with your real host/IP)

### Required GitHub Secrets
- `VPS_PASSWORD`: SSH password for root user
- `PROD_ENV`: Full app env file contents (all runtime envs), for example:
  - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...`
  - `OWNER_USERNAME=...`
  - `OWNER_NAME=...`
  - `ASSISTANT_NAME=Makima`
  - `OWNER_USER_ID=...`
  - `OWNER_CHAT_ID=...`
  - `AUTH_GROUP_IDS=...`
  - `MONGODB_URI=...`
  - `GROQ_API_KEY=...`
  - `GROQ_MODEL=...`
  - `CACHE_MAX_USERS=5000`

### Deploy Flow
- On push to `main` (or manual trigger), workflow:
  - runs `npm ci` + `npm run check`
  - copies app files to VPS path `/opt/tg-reply-bot`
  - writes `prod_env` on VPS from `PROD_ENV` secret
  - runs `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build --remove-orphans`
